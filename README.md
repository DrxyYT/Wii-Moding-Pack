# Wii-Modding-Pack
Welcome to this repo!
Here I'll include anything that could help your Wii Modding become a success!

# Choose a method
I personally recommend the LeterBomb method. It **very** popular and most people use it but other forms can be found here: https://wii.hack.guide/
Link to the LetterBomb site: https://please.hackmii.com/

# Tutorial
If you choose the LetterBomb method here are the steps.

1. Go to Wii Settings
2. Scroll all the way to Internet Settings
3. Go to Console Info and Make a note of your Wii's Mac Address
4. Go to the LetterBomb Site and enter your Wii's Mac Address
5. Make Sure the Option "Bundle the HackMii Installer for me!" is checked
6. Once done cut either wire and the LetterBomb.zip will be downloaded to your computer
7. Open the zip and Copy the files into your Wii's SD Card (Make sure you have a computer that can read and write to the SD Card. If not, buy an adapter that can. And make sure the SD card is formatted to FAT32 otherwise it won't work)
8. If you have a private folder on the SD rename it to privateold
9. Insert the SD Card into your Wii and Power it on.
10. Go to the Wii Message Board and look for the red letter. It should be in Today, Tomorrow, or 2 days ago.
11. Once you have found it, Click it and text will begin to appear.
12. Once the text is done you'll be brought to this screen: https://github.com/DrxyYT/Wii-Moding-Pack/blob/main/ScamScreen.png (you may have to download it)
13. Once the prompt appears click the button and you'll be brought to the HackMii Installer. It'll tell you if the Homebrew Channel can be installed or not. Most likely it can be installed.
14. Press Continue and scroll to "Install the Homebrew Channel" It'll ask to confirm your option. Click "Yes, continue"
15. The process shouldn't take too long. Once done press Continue and then press Exit.
16. Now, you'll be in the Homebrew Channel. It's empty by default and doesn't come with apps.
17. Press the HOME button and then Exit the Wii Menu. You should have the Homebrew Channel on your menu now.

Congrats! Your Wii is now Modded!

# RiiConnect24
In My Homebrew app pack contains some apps you need and it includes the Mail-Patcher. The app won't work if don't have the wad files (The sd card is not needed. it Makes a folder called "Copy-To-SD')
